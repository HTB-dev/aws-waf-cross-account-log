# aws-waf-cross-account-log

I was unable to configure AWS WAF logs from the AWS console when saving them through Kisnesis Firehose to S3 on another account.
CloudFormation Templete to do this configuration. Then it will output the ARN for the IAM Role. Set this IAM Role to the bucket policy you want to save.
